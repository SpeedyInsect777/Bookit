API DAY 09 --> CUCUMBER 


CUCUMBER ALL LAYER UI - API - DB


Project details

    1- Start with dependencies to explain what we need
        Rest Assured --> API
        Selenium     --> Browser Automation Tool
        Bonigarcia(Webdriver Manager) --> Based on browser type we need setup driver.
        It will manage this for use
        Cucumber --> It is for BDD frameworks
        Postgres --> It is driver for Postgres Database
                    if it is MYSQL use MYSQL driver
                    if it is Oracle use ORACLE driver
                    There is no dependency like bonigarcia to manage drivers
        Jackson --> Serilization and Deserilization
                       Databind library , ObjectMapper
                       it will convert

                          POST-PUT-PATCH -->  Java to JSON --> Serialization
                                body()--> method will do it

                          GET --> JSON to Java --> Deserilzation
                                  resposne.as()
                                  jsonPath.
         
         Lombok --> We are using to get rid of boiler plate code from Object Classes
                    @Data @Getter@Settters ....
                    It helps us annotate the class based on what we need

                    But mostly it is used in development

     2- Pages
                TopNavigationBar
                        - Abstract Class--> We are not gonna create object from this class
                        - It is parent for other pages

                 OtherPages are regular pages

     3- runners
                - CukesRunner
                - FailedTestRunner

     4- stepdef
                - Hooks
                       - it will run for every scenario
                       - What is the meaning of @db
                            These are custom hooks
     5- Utilities

                BookitUtils
                BrowserUtils
                ConfigurationReader
                DB_Util
                Driver


--> Database Conection for POSTGRES 

    #database connection info
    dbUsername=qa_user
    dbPassword=Cybertek11!
    dbUrl=jdbc:postgresql://room-reservation-qa.cxvqfpt4mc2y.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/room_reservation_qa



    - Database Tab 
    - Data Sources 
    - Fill necessary field as we did before 
    - Download missing drivers 
    - Apply OK 
    - If tables are not visible REFRESH Connection 


-----------ENV VARIABLES --------------------


 - We have move everything like url,baseurl,db connection string,valid credentials for each user type 
    to new qa1,qa2,qa3.properties file that we created under resources/Environments folder.
    The only info we left in configuration.properties file is

    browser=chrome
    environment=qa2

- Then we have created new Environment class under Utilities package where we have very similar static block 
   with ConfigurationReader. the only difference is we create dynamic path in this new class. 
   it is accepting environment value from our configuration.properties file and generating new path. 
   So based on the environment we have it will load that env file.example

if conf is following;

    browser=chrome
    environment=qa2

    it will create path as following
    environment=ConfiguraitonReader.get("environment") --> this will get env from configuraiton.properties file

String path = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/src/test/resources/Environments/" + environment + ".properties"; 
            --> variable will update and new path will be generated


- Then we have created constant variables to load our env specific properties files so that we can just call them 
  whenever we need it instead of using getters of properties.

        public static final String URL;

        URL = properties.getProperty("url");

        Environment.URL --> usage


Scenario: we have set our environment in configuraiton.propeties file, can we also set it with terminal ?


String environment = System.getProperty("environment")
!= null ? environment = System.getProperty("environment") : ConfigurationReader.get("environment");

So the logic is: if there is environment passed through command line,
 we will use that value to assign  environment.
if not it will get it from ConfigurationReader file just like before.


     


      =>   String environment = System.getProperty("environment")
      != null ? environment = System.getProperty("environment")
        : ConfigurationReader.getProperty("environment");

        System.getProperty("environment") --> It will check and read system variables that defined as environment 

        RUN FROM CUKES
            
            System.getProperty("environment") --> NULL 
            
            ConfigurationReader.getProperty("environment")  will read environment=qa1

            In that case environment will be 
                
                environment =ConfigurationReader.getProperty("environment") 
                environment =qa1

                It will run testcases against qa1
        

        RUN FROM MAVEN

        - Make sure you added plugin 
             <build>
                <plugins>
                    <plugin>
                        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                        <version>3.0.0-M3</version>
                        <configuration>
                            <parallel>methods</parallel>
                            <useUnlimitedThreads>true</useUnlimitedThreads>
                            <testFailureIgnore>true</testFailureIgnore>
                            <runOrder>Alphabetical</runOrder>
                            <includes>
                            <include>**/*CukesRunner.java</include>
                        </includes>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
            </build>  
          
         
         - Run from maven 

         - mvn test  -Denvironment = qa2

            -D --> Defines system variable called as environment

            System.getProperty("environment") != null ? environment = System.getProperty("environment")  

            System.getProperty("environment") is not null and all testcases will run against qa2




JUST LIKE WE DID IN JENKINS

    - We can run tests against different environments with the help of 

        test -Denvironment=qa3 -Dbrowser=firefox -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke" -Dusername  ...........
